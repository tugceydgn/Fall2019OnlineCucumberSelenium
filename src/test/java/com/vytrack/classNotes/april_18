Agenda:

Background
Parameters --> strings and integers
Maven Cucumber HTML Report
Data tables


################################

Background - common steps for all scenarios in one particular feature file. Similar to @Before hook, but not the same.


For example:

@sales_manager
Scenario: Login as sales manager and verify that title is Dashboard
Given user is on the login page
When user logs in as a sales manager
Then user should verify that title is a Dashboard

@store_manager
Scenario: Login as store manager and verify that title is Dashboard
Given user is on the login page
When user logs in as a store manager
Then user should verify that title is a Dashboard

@driver @dashboard
Scenario: Login as driver and verify that title is a Dashboard
Given user is on the login page
When user logs in as a driver
Then user should verify that title is a Dashboard

With a background, it will look like this:

Background: open login page
Given user is on the login page

@sales_manager
Scenario: Login as sales manager and verify that title is Dashboard
When user logs in as a sales manager
Then user should verify that title is a Dashboard

@store_manager
Scenario: Login as store manager and verify that title is Dashboard
When user logs in as a store manager
Then user should verify that title is a Dashboard

@driver @dashboard
Scenario: Login as driver and verify that title is a Dashboard
When user logs in as a driver
Then user should verify that title is a Dashboard


Order of execution:

Before hook --> Background steps --> Scenario --> After hook


If hook applies on all feature files, Background will be applied only for the feature feature, where it was declared.


Background - can take as many steps as you need.

Usually, it's used when you are keep repeating Given step in some feature file.

In Jira Xray, Background is equals to Precondition.



############################################################################

Anything in double quotes becomes a parameter (string).

#In feature file

When user enters "storemanager85" username and "UserUser123" password

#In step definition class

@When("user enters {string} username and {string} password")
public void user_enters_username_and_password(String string, String string2) {

}

string - will have value "storemanager85"
string2 - will have value "UserUser123"

Once we have implemented steps, we can change values in double quotes. Because - it's a parameter.


%s - string


order is from left right always!


Step definitions independent from steps; can be reused by other scenarios as well. Cucumber goes into steps and then goes to step definitions looks for matching steps.
Cucumber take step definitions as blocks.
But for same step 2 different implementation is not possible !!

sometimes, webdriver performs text input very slow. To fit it, we use explicit wait:

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.attributeToBe(element, "value", text));



value attribute stores text input, so we just wait until it will receive entire text input.


#################################################

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/[note 1]) is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value)


JSON - javascript object notation. Contains only properties, objects and collections. There is no methods. Very popular type of document to transmit information between 2 programs --> used for API.

JSON natively supported by javascript, because it derives from it.

Java as well as other languages have lots of libraries that allow to work with JSON files.

JSON - looks like a plain text file.

{
property: value
}

Example of simple JSON file.

{
user: [
name: "John"
age: 25
jobTitle: "SDET"
]

}


Cucumber, is able to generate JSON report. Then, that json file, can be used by 3rd party plugins to generate some fancy HTML report. (not that ugly as default one)


One of the most popular is Maven Cucumber HTML report. To add it, we just need to insert it into pom.xml file as a plugin.





github of the report: https://github.com/damianszczepanik/maven-cucumber-reporting


we need to add maven-surefire plugin, to execute our tests with maven command.


to generate report, we need to run verify maven goal.

either:

mvn verify


or from intellij --> maven --> life cycle --> verify

also, clean before running tests:


mvn clean verify

clean - to delete target folder.



report will be generate only with verify goal. If you will run CucumbeRunner class manually, this report won't be generated.


mvn clean verify -q

-q - quite execution. minimizes maven console log


If mvn command gives error, that means maven is no installed. Still you can use maven from intellij, but you won't be able to use outside of intellij, as CLI tool.



##############################################


Cucumber Data Table - is used to extend test step. It allows to attach table to test step.




Cucumber data table:

// Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
// For automatic transformation, change DataTable to one of
// E, List<E>, List<List<E>>, List<Map<K,V>>, Map<K,V> or
// Map<K, List<V>>. E,K,V must be a String, Integer, Float,
// Double, Byte, Short, Long, BigInteger or BigDecimal.
//
// For other transformations you can register a DataTableType.



1 column - List<String>

2 columns - Map<String, String> - where keys will be always on the left, and values on the right.

2+ columns - List<Map<String, String>> - where keys will be always on the first row.

2+ columns - Map<String, List<String>>


If you specified data type as a Map, use get("keyName") to read values:


dataTable.get("description");
dataTable.get("title");

By default, any step definition method with data table will have a parameter - io.cucumber.datatable.DataTable dataTable;


DataTable - data structure from Cucumber BDD. Can be transformed into something more commonly used like: List, Map, List<Map>, etc.. depends on how many columns do you have in the data table.



Don't use DataTable, change it to something else....

if you specify non-existing key name, you will get - NULL.


make sure, that key name is correct.


#########################################

Background - common steps in the beginning

Parameters - used to make test steps more flexible. To provide a parameter surround some phrase with double quotes, then it will be injected into step definition as a parameter.

Cucumber HTML report - 3rd party reporting plugin, not officially developed by cucumber team. To use it, add plugin into pom.xml file. Make sure you also have maven-surefire/maven-failsafe plugin to trigger CucumberRunner class. Also, don't forget to specify in runner class json report:

"json:target/cucumber.json"

to get the report, execute verify maven goal.

Data table

is used to extend some test step. It allows to fit more test data into one step. Data will stored as a table. Values reside in between pipes |values|.



Tomorrow, we will continue data tables.
