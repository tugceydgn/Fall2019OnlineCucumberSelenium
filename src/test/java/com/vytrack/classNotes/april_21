Agenda: Scenario Outline



################

Scenario Outline is used for data driven testing. Whenever you have couple of scenarios with exactly same test steps but different test data, use scenario outline.


Scenario Outline must be followed by Examples table

To use values from the table, specify parameter name in between angled brackets <name>

One scenario outline can have couple examples tables

As many rows of records you have in examples table, as many times scenario outline will be execute

Every row in examples table represents some test case

Scenario Outline can be used only when group of tests have same steps but different test data

Scenario Outline: User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "<username>" username and "<password>" password
Then user name should be "<name>"

Examples:
| username | password | name |
| user187 | UserUser123 | Jerel Vandervort | 1
| user200 | UserUser123 | Lonzo Leuschke | 2
| storemanager52 | UserUser123 | Roma Medhurst | 3
| storemanager66 | UserUser123 | Carlos Ernser | 4
| salesmanager125 | UserUser123 | Cleveland Heller | 5
| salesmanager140 | UserUser123 | Jameson Paucek | 6

# Test + DataProvider = Scenario Outline + Examples table

Scenario: 1. User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "user187" username and "UserUser123" password
Then user name should be "Jerel Vandervort"

Scenario: 2. User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "user200" username and "UserUser123" password
Then user name should be "Lonzo Leuschke"

Scenario: 3. User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "storemanager52" username and "UserUser123" password
Then user name should be "Roma Medhurst"

Scenario: 4. User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "storemanager66" username and "UserUser123" password
Then user name should be "Carlos Ernser"

Scenario: 5. User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "salesmanager125" username and "UserUser123" password
Then user name should be "Cleveland Heller"

Scenario: 6. User names test
Given user is on the landing page
When user enters "salesmanager140" username and "UserUser123" password
Then user name should be "Jameson Paucek"

Examples is required by Scenario Outline. Wheres data table, is optional and used to expand some test step. Basically, to fit more test data into one test step.

Scenario Outline: Go to <module> and verify title: <title>
Given user is on the login page
When user logs in as "<user_type>"
And user navigates to "<tab>" and "<module>"
Then user verifies that page title is "<title>"

Examples:
| user_type | tab | module | title |
